        <p>
          We at Farmwise Fresh Eats believe that the best-tasting and most
          nutritious foods are those that are organically grown on small local
          growers as opposed to those found at the supermarket produced by giant
          corporate farms. This is because the produce offered at farmer's
          markets is grown by independent farmers who truly care about their
          product, rather than supermarket produce grown by corporations that
          are more concerned with turning a profit than the quality of their
          final product or the well-being of its consumers. Because we feel so
          strongly about the benefits of eating local produce, we created an app
          that allows users to find the closest farmer's markets no matter where
          they are. If you are not convinced, we've compiled a list of ten
          reasons why farmer's markets are best not just for you, but for your
          community- and the environment as a whole.
