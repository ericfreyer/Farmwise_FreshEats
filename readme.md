## Farmwise Fresh Eats

Your one-stop shop for finding farmers markets near you. 

## Description

The truth is out there; maintaining a healthy, fresh, balanced diet is vital to your overall health and wellbeing, and the fresher the ingredients in your food, the better. Buying from a Farmer's market delivers the one-two punch of not only being good for yourself, but for your community and the environment along with it. 

But finding a farmer's market isn't always easy. 

Enter Farmwise Fresh Eats. Asking only for your zip code, our easy to use and intuitive interface shows you markets in your area at a glance. Simply click on a market to plot its location on a map, see details on goods sold, and how early (and late!) they're open. Farmwise Fresh Eats draws directly from the USDA's database of registered markets, ensuring that the data you see is as up to date and accurate as can be. 

## Features

- Mobile Oriented: Farmwise Fresh Eats features a lightweight, easy to read format made possible by visualize and dynamically rendered HTML. Content is rendered dashboard style, so you only see what you need to see, saving valuable data and bandwidth.

- Persistant: client-side local storage remembers which zip codes you searched for. Recall results with a tap or a click, on the go or otherwise. 

- Informative: Eating healthy is vital, but knowing how buying local benefits yourself and your community is too. 

- Cookie-free maps: OpenLayers powers a scalable map that doesn't require cookies, and is light on data to boot.
